[ValleyBike.org](https://www.valleybike.org/) data package. 

For the reproducible data curation process, check out the [Data Import Workflow Documentation](https://amherst-statistics.github.io/valleybikeData/). For more specific information on the datasets and utility functions included, see the [package manual](https://github.com/Amherst-Statistics/valleybikeData/blob/master/valleybikeData_0.0.1.pdf).

## Installation

Install the development version from GitHub:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("Amherst-Statistics/valleybikeData")
library(valleybikeData)
```

## Datasets

The package includes all currently-available ValleyBike trajectory data in month-by-month chunks, as well as additional aggregates data on individual users and trips. A dataset containing all permanent bikeshare stations is also included.

| Dataset Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `trips` | one-row-per-trip data, including variables like duration, start and end times, start and end stations, etc. |
| `stations` | data on all permanent ValleyBike stations |
| `users` | one-row-per-user data, including variables like total number of trips, time and date of first trip, top start and end stations, etc. |
| `june2018`, `july2018`, `august2018`, `september2018`, `october2018`, `november2018`, `april2019`, `may2019`, `june2019`, `july2019`, `august2019`, `september2019`, `october2019`, `november2019`, `june2020`, `july2020`, `august2020`, `september2020`, ... `may2021` | by-month trajectory data for all active months of ValleyBike, collected at 5-second intervals during each trip |

## Functions

The package also includes a variety of utility functions for importing the raw data:

- `import_day` (import a single day's worth of data from source)
- `import_month` (import a month's worth of data from source)
- `get_full_data` (get all available data from source)
- `aggregate_trips` (aggregate a one-row-per-trip dataset)
- `aggregate_users` (aggregate a one-row-per-user dataset)
- `download_files` (download raw .csv.gz data files from online mirror)

Lastly, `get_monthly_dataset` is another important utility function provided by the package. It can be used to access a monthly trajectory dataset through the numeric representation of its corresponding month and year. This is useful when data access must be automated, so writing out dataset names like `"july2019"` becomes inconvenient. Instead, one can call `get_monthly_dataset`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# returns the july2019 dataset
get_monthly_dataset(month = 7, year = 2019)
```

For more details on what these functions do and how to use them, please see the [package manual](https://github.com/Amherst-Statistics/valleybikeData/blob/master/valleybikeData_0.0.1.pdf).
